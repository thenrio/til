one argument, easy

    inc :: int -> int
    inc i = i + 1

but why is there so many -> like so

    xor :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool

see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Type_basics#Functions_with_more_than_one_argument

not _intuitive_ because it was an itch for me :)

* last type is returned type
* all others are function params ...
