see https://www.mail-archive.com/debian-bugs-rc@lists.debian.org/msg444657.html

faulty version is 54.0.2840.101-1

scale is correct and display gmail crashes

option is to install 53.0.2785.143-1

(did not invest in pinning... I expect an fix to be available soon).

Now, the next time, I'll pin.
pinning enables apt-get clean (wipe /var/cache/apt/archives that holds the package 53.0.2785.143-1 not buggy).

and functional archive is desirable...
