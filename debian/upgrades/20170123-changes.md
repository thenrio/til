---------------------

chromium-browser (55.0.2883.75-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * External extensions are now disabled by default.  Chromium will only load
    extensions that are explicitly specified with the --load-extension command
    line option passed into CHROMIUM_FLAGS.  See the chromium-lwn4chrome
    package for an example of how to do this.
  * You can also use the --enable-remote-extensions command line argument to
    chromium, which will bypass this restriction.

ifupdown (0.8.17) unstable; urgency=medium

  Ifupdown now also configures VLANs for bridge interfaces. (Previously, the
  bridge-utils package integrated with the vlan package to do this via if-up
  hooks, however since bridge-utils 1.5-11 this integration has been removed.)

openssl (1.1.0c-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  The openssl enc command changed the default digest (used to create the key
  from passphrase) from MD5 to SHA256 since the version 1.1.0. The digest can
  be specified with the -md option.
