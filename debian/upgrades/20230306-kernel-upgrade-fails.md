I don't have the log, there but:

* `apt dist-upgrade` on current kernel 6.6.9 failed 
* `apt install -f` asked whether to remove current kernel was a good idea, with recommend not to do it??

Resolution was to `apt install -f` with "old" kernel, 6.7.7...
I had misread the kernels! I though the old one was 6.7.7!
