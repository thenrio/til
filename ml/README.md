https://github.com/karanchahal/DoodleMaster, ui => pytorch => render

> The Doodle Master seeks to turn your UI mockups into real code.
> Currently this repository just serves to demonstrate a Proof Of Concept of Artificially Intelligent Design Tools.

> This demo uses a simple CNN for the classification of the doodles made.
> The software is able to localise the UI element through a combination of geometric techniques and simple mouse/finger position detection.
> Frameworks used are:
>
> * Deep Learning Model = Pytorch
> * UI = HTML/CSS
